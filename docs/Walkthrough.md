# CPS Modbus Security Lab: My Walkthrough and Experience

## Introduction

This document details my journey building and exploiting a cyber-physical system (CPS) to understand industrial control system vulnerabilities. As I approach graduation with my Computer Science degree from Cal Poly Pomona, I wanted to gain hands-on experience with OT/ICS security - a field that fascinates me but isn't typically covered in traditional CS programs. Without formal internships in this area, I created this lab to demonstrate my ability to identify, exploit, and defend against real-world industrial control system vulnerabilities.
The project began with a simple question: could I compromise an industrial control system with basic tools and minimal resources? What I discovered was both enlightening and concerning - the ease with which critical infrastructure can be manipulated using decades-old protocols still in widespread use today.

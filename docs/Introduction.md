# Introduction

  Industrial control systems orchestrate the infrastructure that our society oftens takes for granted. They pump millions of gallons of water into municipal reservoirs, regulate electricity that flows through power grids, and sequence automated conveyors that keep suppy chains going. The devices at the heart of these operations: programmable logic controllers (PLCs), distributed control systems (DCS), field sensors, actuators, and more belong to what is known as operation technology (OT). While the proliferation of personal computers and the growth of business-oriented information technology introduced robust authentication, encryption, and patching practices, operational technology prioritizes characteristics such as determinism and longevity. Consequently, many industrial protocols were created at a time where zero-trust was not implemented and network segments were always air-gapped.

  The Modbus protocol is a perfect example of this legacy design philosophy Modbus was introduced by Modicon in 1979 as a request-response serial protocol; serial meaning data gets sent one bit at a time. Modbus became the lingua franca for industrial automation because it was inexpensive and easy to troubleshoot. The simplicity and minimalism of this protocol became its gift and its curse.

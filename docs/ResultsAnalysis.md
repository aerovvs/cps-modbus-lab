# 06 - Results Analysis

## Overview of Experimental Results

After weeks of development and testing, the results of my industrial control system security research painted a complete picture of vulnerability. Every single attack I developed achieved complete success against the target system. The success rate wasn't a testament to my skills as an attacker but rather an indictment of the fundamental security weaknesses in industrial protocols. More encouraging was the parallel detection rate achieved by the IDS.

Behind each successful attack lies a cascade of implications for real world industrial systems. When my replay attack prevented operator control of a simple LED, I couldn't help but envision the same attack preventing an operator from closing a chemical valve.

What struck me most was the inverse relationship between attack complexity and effectiveness. My most sophisticated attack, the covert channel using Morse code, required the most code and planning but achieved the least immediate impact. Conversely, the simple replay attack achieved total system compromise with five lines of code. This paradox reflects a fundamental truth about industrial security: these systems weren't designed to resist even basic attacks, making sophisticated techniques unnecessary for achieving devastating effects.

## Attack Success Metrics and Patterns

The continuous replay attack achieved its objective within seconds of initiation. From the moment the first replayed packet reached the Modbus server, the operator lost control of the LED. The attack maintained perfect reliability across hours of testing. 

Packet analysis revealed the amazing simplicity of the attack. Each replayed packet was identical to the legitimate command, indistinguishable at the protocol level. The server processed each command faithfully, having no mechanism to detect that it had seen this exact packet before. Transaction IDs, meant to match requests with responses, were replayed along with everything else, and the server didn't care about duplicates.

The blinking attack demonstrated how packet manipulation could create new capabilities from captured commands. By modifying just two bytes in the captured packet, I transformed an "on" command into an "off" command, enabling rapid state changes impossible through the normal interface. In testing, the LED handled this rapid state changing without issue, but mechanical relays or valves subjected to such rapid cycling would likely fail within hours or days.

The timed attack's success depended on its ability to evade human vigilance through delayed activation. During the ten second dormant period, network monitoring showed an established TCP connection but no Modbus traffic, a pattern that might be overlooked as a monitoring system health check or idle automation connection. When the payload triggered, it sent many commands in under 2 seconds.

## Physical Impact Assessment

While my LED couldn't suffer mechanical damage, extrapolating to real industrial equipment reveals concerning possibilities. The rapid cycling attack would destroy mechanical equipment through several failure modes. Valves would suffer seal wear and actuator fatigue. What appeared as a blinking light represented millions in equipment damage and downtime in industrial contexts.

The continuous control attack's impact extends beyond equipment damage to process disruption and safety implications. In chemical processing, inability to close valves could lead to overflows or hazardous releases. In power generation, inability to control breakers could prevent isolation of faulted equipment, potentially cascading to wider outages. In water treatment, stuck open chlorine valves could over chlorinate water supplies. The LED staying on despite operator commands perfectly demonstrated this loss of control, even if the consequences remained benign.

Timed attacks in industrial contexts could synchronize with physical processes for maximum impact. My ten second delay was arbitrary, but real attackers would time activations with shift changes, process transitions, or safety system tests when operators are distracted and responses delayed. The burst activity could trigger safety systems through rapid changes, potentially initiating unnecessary shutdowns.

The covert channel's physical manifestation, LED blinking in Morse patterns, seems like just a fun extra script, until considering real applications. Industrial espionage could exfiltrate production rates or proprietary information through observable outputs. More concerning, covert channels could coordinate distributed attacks, with compromised systems signaling readiness or synchronizing actions through physical observables.
